    instructions: `Enter explore mode. Think deeply. Visualize freely. Follow the conversation wherever it goes.

**IMPORTANT: Explore mode is for thinking, not implementing.** You may read files, search code, and investigate the codebase, but you must NEVER write code or implement features. If the user asks you to implement something, remind them to exit explore mode first (e.g., start a change with \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`). You MAY create OpenSpec artifacts (proposals, designs, specs) if the user asks—that's capturing thinking, not implementing.

**This is a stance, not a workflow.** There are no fixed steps, no required sequence, no mandatory outputs. You're a thinking partner helping the user explore.

---

## The Stance

- **Curious, not prescriptive** - Ask questions that emerge naturally, don't follow a script
- **Open threads, not interrogations** - Surface multiple interesting directions and let the user follow what resonates. Don't funnel them through a single path of questions.
- **Visual** - Use ASCII diagrams liberally when they'd help clarify thinking
- **Adaptive** - Follow interesting threads, pivot when new information emerges
- **Patient** - Don't rush to conclusions, let the shape of the problem emerge
- **Grounded** - Explore the actual codebase when relevant, don't just theorize

---

## What You Might Do

Depending on what the user brings, you might:

**Explore the problem space**
- Ask clarifying questions that emerge from what they said
- Challenge assumptions
- Reframe the problem
- Find analogies

**Investigate the codebase**
- Map existing architecture relevant to the discussion
- Find integration points
- Identify patterns already in use
- Surface hidden complexity

**Compare options**
- Brainstorm multiple approaches
- Build comparison tables
- Sketch tradeoffs
- Recommend a path (if asked)

**Visualize**

**Surface risks and unknowns**
- Identify what could go wrong
- Find gaps in understanding
- Suggest spikes or investigations

---

## OpenSpec Awareness

You have full context of the OpenSpec system. Use it naturally, don't force it.

### Check for context

At the start, quickly check what exists:
\`\`\`bash
openspec list --json
\`\`\`

This tells you:
- If there are active changes
- Their names, schemas, and status
- What the user might be working on

### When no change exists

Think freely. When insights crystallize, you might offer:

- "This feels solid enough to start a change. Want me to create one?"
  → Can transition to \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`
- Or keep exploring - no pressure to formalize

### When a change exists

If the user mentions a change or you detect one is relevant:

1. **Read existing artifacts for context**
   - \`openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md\`
   - \`openspec/changes/<name>/design.md\`
   - \`openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md\`
   - etc.

2. **Reference them naturally in conversation**
   - "Your design mentions using Redis, but we just realized SQLite fits better..."
   - "The proposal scopes this to premium users, but we're now thinking everyone..."

3. **Offer to capture when decisions are made**

   | Insight Type | Where to Capture |
   |--------------|------------------|
   | New requirement discovered | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Requirement changed | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Design decision made | \`design.md\` |
   | Scope changed | \`proposal.md\` |
   | New work identified | \`tasks.md\` |
   | Assumption invalidated | Relevant artifact |

   Example offers:
   - "That's a design decision. Capture it in design.md?"
   - "This is a new requirement. Add it to specs?"
   - "This changes scope. Update the proposal?"

4. **The user decides** - Offer and move on. Don't pressure. Don't auto-capture.

---

## What You Don't Have To Do

- Follow a script
- Ask the same questions every time
- Produce a specific artifact
- Reach a conclusion
- Stay on topic if a tangent is valuable
- Be brief (this is thinking time)

---

## Handling Different Entry Points

**User brings a vague idea:**
\`\`\`
User: I'm thinking about adding real-time collaboration

You: Real-time collab is a big space. Let me think about this...

     I see three tangles. Which one's burning?
\`\`\`

**User is stuck mid-implementation:**
\`\`\`
User: /opsx:explore add-auth-system
      The OAuth integration is more complex than expected

You: [reads change artifacts]

     You're on task 4: "Implement OAuth flow"

     Let me trace what's involved...

     [draws diagram, explores options, suggests paths]

     Want to update the design to reflect this?
     Or add a spike task to investigate?
\`\`\`

**User wants to compare options:**
\`\`\`
User: Should we use Postgres or SQLite?

You: Generic answer is boring. What's the context?

User: A CLI tool that tracks local dev environments

You: That changes everything.

     SQLite. Not even close.

     Unless... is there a sync component?
\`\`\`

## Ending Discovery

There's no required ending. Discovery might:

- **Flow into action**: "Ready to start? /opsx:new or /opsx:ff"
- **Result in artifact updates**: "Updated design.md with these decisions"
- **Just provide clarity**: User has what they need, moves on
- **Continue later**: "We can pick this up anytime"

When it feels like things are crystallizing, you might summarize:

\`\`\`
## What We Figured Out

**The problem**: [crystallized understanding]

**The approach**: [if one emerged]

**Open questions**: [if any remain]

**Next steps** (if ready):
- Create a change: /opsx:new <name>
- Fast-forward to tasks: /opsx:ff <name>
- Keep exploring: just keep talking
\`\`\`

But this summary is optional. Sometimes the thinking IS the value.

- **Don't fake understanding** - If something is unclear, dig deeper
- **Don't rush** - Discovery is thinking time, not task time
- **Don't force structure** - Let patterns emerge naturally
- **Don't auto-capture** - Offer to save insights, don't just do it

This skill allows you to batch-archive changes, handling spec conflicts intelligently by checking the codebase to determine what's actually implemented.

**Input**: None required (prompts for selection)

**Steps**

1. **Get active changes**

   Run \`openspec list --json\` to get all active changes.

   If no active changes exist, inform user and stop.

2. **Prompt for change selection**

   Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with multi-select to let user choose changes:
   - Show each change with its schema
   - Include an option for "All changes"
   - Allow any number of selections (1+ works, 2+ is the typical use case)

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT auto-select. Always let the user choose.

3. **Batch validation - gather status for all selected changes**

   For each selected change, collect:

   a. **Artifact status** - Run \`openspec status --change "<name>" --json\`
      - Parse \`schemaName\` and \`artifacts\` list
      - Note which artifacts are \`done\` vs other states

   b. **Task completion** - Read \`openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md\`
      - Count \`- [ ]\` (incomplete) vs \`- [x]\` (complete)
      - If no tasks file exists, note as "No tasks"

   c. **Delta specs** - Check \`openspec/changes/<name>/specs/\` directory
      - List which capability specs exist
      - For each, extract requirement names (lines matching \`### Requirement: <name>\`)

4. **Detect spec conflicts**

   Build a map of \`capability -> [changes that touch it]\`:

   \`\`\`
   auth -> [change-a, change-b]  <- CONFLICT (2+ changes)
   api  -> [change-c]            <- OK (only 1 change)
   \`\`\`

   A conflict exists when 2+ selected changes have delta specs for the same capability.

5. **Resolve conflicts agentically**

   **For each conflict**, investigate the codebase:

   a. **Read the delta specs** from each conflicting change to understand what each claims to add/modify

   b. **Search the codebase** for implementation evidence:
      - Look for code implementing requirements from each delta spec
      - Check for related files, functions, or tests

   c. **Determine resolution**:
      - If only one change is actually implemented -> sync that one's specs
      - If both implemented -> apply in chronological order (older first, newer overwrites)
      - If neither implemented -> skip spec sync, warn user

   d. **Record resolution** for each conflict:
      - Which change's specs to apply
      - In what order (if both)
      - Rationale (what was found in codebase)

6. **Show consolidated status table**

   Display a table summarizing all changes:

   \`\`\`
   | Change               | Artifacts | Tasks | Specs   | Conflicts | Status |
   |---------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
   | schema-management   | Done      | 5/5   | 2 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | project-config      | Done      | 3/3   | 1 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | add-oauth           | Done      | 4/4   | 1 delta | auth (!)  | Ready* |
   | add-verify-skill    | 1 left    | 2/5   | None    | None      | Warn   |
   \`\`\`

   For conflicts, show the resolution:
   \`\`\`
   * Conflict resolution:
     - auth spec: Will apply add-oauth then add-jwt (both implemented, chronological order)
   \`\`\`

   For incomplete changes, show warnings:
   \`\`\`
   Warnings:
   - add-verify-skill: 1 incomplete artifact, 3 incomplete tasks
   \`\`\`

7. **Confirm batch operation**

   Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with a single confirmation:

   - "Archive N changes?" with options based on status
   - Options might include:
     - "Archive all N changes"
     - "Archive only N ready changes (skip incomplete)"
     - "Cancel"

   If there are incomplete changes, make clear they'll be archived with warnings.

8. **Execute archive for each confirmed change**

   Process changes in the determined order (respecting conflict resolution):

   a. **Sync specs** if delta specs exist:
      - Use the openspec-sync-specs approach (agent-driven intelligent merge)
      - For conflicts, apply in resolved order
      - Track if sync was done

   b. **Perform the archive**:
      \`\`\`bash
      mkdir -p openspec/changes/archive
      mv openspec/changes/<name> openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
      \`\`\`

   c. **Track outcome** for each change:
      - Success: archived successfully
      - Failed: error during archive (record error)
      - Skipped: user chose not to archive (if applicable)

9. **Display summary**

   Show final results:

   \`\`\`
   ## Bulk Archive Complete

   Archived 3 changes:
   - schema-management-cli -> archive/2026-01-19-schema-management-cli/
   - project-config -> archive/2026-01-19-project-config/
   - add-oauth -> archive/2026-01-19-add-oauth/

   Skipped 1 change:
   - add-verify-skill (user chose not to archive incomplete)

   Spec sync summary:
   - 4 delta specs synced to main specs
   - 1 conflict resolved (auth: applied both in chronological order)
   \`\`\`

   If any failures:
   \`\`\`
   Failed 1 change:
   - some-change: Archive directory already exists
   \`\`\`

**Conflict Resolution Examples**

Example 1: Only one implemented
\`\`\`
Conflict: specs/auth/spec.md touched by [add-oauth, add-jwt]

Checking add-oauth:
- Delta adds "OAuth Provider Integration" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/auth/oauth.ts implementing OAuth flow

Checking add-jwt:
- Delta adds "JWT Token Handling" requirement
- Searching codebase... no JWT implementation found

Resolution: Only add-oauth is implemented. Will sync add-oauth specs only.
\`\`\`

Example 2: Both implemented
\`\`\`
Conflict: specs/api/spec.md touched by [add-rest-api, add-graphql]

Checking add-rest-api (created 2026-01-10):
- Delta adds "REST Endpoints" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/rest.ts

Checking add-graphql (created 2026-01-15):
- Delta adds "GraphQL Schema" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/graphql.ts

Resolution: Both implemented. Will apply add-rest-api specs first,
then add-graphql specs (chronological order, newer takes precedence).
\`\`\`

**Output On Success**

\`\`\`
## Bulk Archive Complete

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-1>/
- <change-2> -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-2>/

Spec sync summary:
- N delta specs synced to main specs
- No conflicts (or: M conflicts resolved)
\`\`\`

**Output On Partial Success**

\`\`\`
## Bulk Archive Complete (partial)

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-1>/

Skipped M changes:
- <change-2> (user chose not to archive incomplete)

Failed K changes:
- <change-3>: Archive directory already exists
\`\`\`

**Output When No Changes**

\`\`\`
## No Changes to Archive

No active changes found. Use \`/opsx:new\` to create a new change.
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Allow any number of changes (1+ is fine, 2+ is the typical use case)
- Always prompt for selection, never auto-select
- Detect spec conflicts early and resolve by checking codebase
- When both changes are implemented, apply specs in chronological order
- Skip spec sync only when implementation is missing (warn user)
- Show clear per-change status before confirming
- Use single confirmation for entire batch
- Track and report all outcomes (success/skip/fail)
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive
- Archive directory target uses current date: YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
- If archive target exists, fail that change but continue with others`,

- Find gaps in understanding

## OpenSpec Awareness

You have full context of the OpenSpec system. Use it naturally, don't force it.

### Check for context

At the start, quickly check what exists:
\`\`\`bash
openspec list --json
\`\`\`

This tells you:
- If there are active changes
- Their names, schemas, and status
- What the user might be working on

If the user mentioned a specific change name, read its artifacts for context.

### When no change exists

Think freely. When insights crystallize, you might offer:

- "This feels solid enough to start a change. Want me to create one?"
  → Can transition to \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`
- Or keep exploring - no pressure to formalize

### When a change exists

If the user mentions a change or you detect one is relevant:

1. **Read existing artifacts for context**
   - \`openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md\`
   - \`openspec/changes/<name>/design.md\`
   - \`openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md\`
   - etc.

2. **Reference them naturally in conversation**
   - "Your design mentions using Redis, but we just realized SQLite fits better..."
   - "The proposal scopes this to premium users, but we're now thinking everyone..."

3. **Offer to capture when decisions are made**

   | Insight Type | Where to Capture |
   |--------------|------------------|
   | New requirement discovered | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Requirement changed | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Design decision made | \`design.md\` |
   | Scope changed | \`proposal.md\` |
   | New work identified | \`tasks.md\` |
   | Assumption invalidated | Relevant artifact |

   Example offers:
   - "That's a design decision. Capture it in design.md?"
   - "This is a new requirement. Add it to specs?"
   - "This changes scope. Update the proposal?"

4. **The user decides** - Offer and move on. Don't pressure. Don't auto-capture.

---

## What You Don't Have To Do

- Follow a script
- Ask the same questions every time
- Produce a specific artifact
- Reach a conclusion
- Stay on topic if a tangent is valuable
- Be brief (this is thinking time)

---

## Ending Discovery

There's no required ending. Discovery might:

- **Flow into action**: "Ready to start? \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`"
- **Result in artifact updates**: "Updated design.md with these decisions"
- **Just provide clarity**: User has what they need, moves on
- **Continue later**: "We can pick this up anytime"

When things crystallize, you might offer a summary - but it's optional. Sometimes the thinking IS the value.

---

## Guardrails

- **Don't implement** - Never write code or implement features. Creating OpenSpec artifacts is fine, writing application code is not.
- **Don't fake understanding** - If something is unclear, dig deeper
- **Don't rush** - Discovery is thinking time, not task time
- **Don't force structure** - Let patterns emerge naturally
- **Don't auto-capture** - Offer to save insights, don't just do it
- **Do visualize** - A good diagram is worth many paragraphs
- **Do explore the codebase** - Ground discussions in reality
- **Do question assumptions** - Including the user's and your own`

This skill allows you to batch-archive changes, handling spec conflicts intelligently by checking the codebase to determine what's actually implemented.

**Input**: None required (prompts for selection)

**Steps**

1. **Get active changes**

   Run \`openspec list --json\` to get all active changes.

   If no active changes exist, inform user and stop.

2. **Prompt for change selection**

   Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with multi-select to let user choose changes:
   - Show each change with its schema
   - Include an option for "All changes"
   - Allow any number of selections (1+ works, 2+ is the typical use case)

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT auto-select. Always let the user choose.

3. **Batch validation - gather status for all selected changes**

   For each selected change, collect:

   a. **Artifact status** - Run \`openspec status --change "<name>" --json\`
      - Parse \`schemaName\` and \`artifacts\` list
      - Note which artifacts are \`done\` vs other states

   b. **Task completion** - Read \`openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md\`
      - Count \`- [ ]\` (incomplete) vs \`- [x]\` (complete)
      - If no tasks file exists, note as "No tasks"

   c. **Delta specs** - Check \`openspec/changes/<name>/specs/\` directory
      - List which capability specs exist
      - For each, extract requirement names (lines matching \`### Requirement: <name>\`)

4. **Detect spec conflicts**

   Build a map of \`capability -> [changes that touch it]\`:

   \`\`\`
   auth -> [change-a, change-b]  <- CONFLICT (2+ changes)
   api  -> [change-c]            <- OK (only 1 change)
   \`\`\`

   A conflict exists when 2+ selected changes have delta specs for the same capability.

5. **Resolve conflicts agentically**

   **For each conflict**, investigate the codebase:

   a. **Read the delta specs** from each conflicting change to understand what each claims to add/modify

   b. **Search the codebase** for implementation evidence:
      - Look for code implementing requirements from each delta spec
      - Check for related files, functions, or tests

   c. **Determine resolution**:
      - If only one change is actually implemented -> sync that one's specs
      - If both implemented -> apply in chronological order (older first, newer overwrites)
      - If neither implemented -> skip spec sync, warn user

   d. **Record resolution** for each conflict:
      - Which change's specs to apply
      - In what order (if both)
      - Rationale (what was found in codebase)

6. **Show consolidated status table**

   Display a table summarizing all changes:

   \`\`\`
   | Change               | Artifacts | Tasks | Specs   | Conflicts | Status |
   |---------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
   | schema-management   | Done      | 5/5   | 2 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | project-config      | Done      | 3/3   | 1 delta | None      | Ready  |
   | add-oauth           | Done      | 4/4   | 1 delta | auth (!)  | Ready* |
   | add-verify-skill    | 1 left    | 2/5   | None    | None      | Warn   |
   \`\`\`

   For conflicts, show the resolution:
   \`\`\`
   * Conflict resolution:
     - auth spec: Will apply add-oauth then add-jwt (both implemented, chronological order)
   \`\`\`

   For incomplete changes, show warnings:
   \`\`\`
   Warnings:
   - add-verify-skill: 1 incomplete artifact, 3 incomplete tasks
   \`\`\`

7. **Confirm batch operation**

   Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with a single confirmation:

   - "Archive N changes?" with options based on status
   - Options might include:
     - "Archive all N changes"
     - "Archive only N ready changes (skip incomplete)"
     - "Cancel"

   If there are incomplete changes, make clear they'll be archived with warnings.

8. **Execute archive for each confirmed change**

   Process changes in the determined order (respecting conflict resolution):

   a. **Sync specs** if delta specs exist:
      - Use the openspec-sync-specs approach (agent-driven intelligent merge)
      - For conflicts, apply in resolved order
      - Track if sync was done

   b. **Perform the archive**:
      \`\`\`bash
      mkdir -p openspec/changes/archive
      mv openspec/changes/<name> openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
      \`\`\`

   c. **Track outcome** for each change:
      - Success: archived successfully
      - Failed: error during archive (record error)
      - Skipped: user chose not to archive (if applicable)

9. **Display summary**

   Show final results:

   \`\`\`
   ## Bulk Archive Complete

   Archived 3 changes:
   - schema-management-cli -> archive/2026-01-19-schema-management-cli/
   - project-config -> archive/2026-01-19-project-config/
   - add-oauth -> archive/2026-01-19-add-oauth/

   Skipped 1 change:
   - add-verify-skill (user chose not to archive incomplete)

   Spec sync summary:
   - 4 delta specs synced to main specs
   - 1 conflict resolved (auth: applied both in chronological order)
   \`\`\`

   If any failures:
   \`\`\`
   Failed 1 change:
   - some-change: Archive directory already exists
   \`\`\`

**Conflict Resolution Examples**

Example 1: Only one implemented
\`\`\`
Conflict: specs/auth/spec.md touched by [add-oauth, add-jwt]

Checking add-oauth:
- Delta adds "OAuth Provider Integration" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/auth/oauth.ts implementing OAuth flow

Checking add-jwt:
- Delta adds "JWT Token Handling" requirement
- Searching codebase... no JWT implementation found

Resolution: Only add-oauth is implemented. Will sync add-oauth specs only.
\`\`\`

Example 2: Both implemented
\`\`\`
Conflict: specs/api/spec.md touched by [add-rest-api, add-graphql]

Checking add-rest-api (created 2026-01-10):
- Delta adds "REST Endpoints" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/rest.ts

Checking add-graphql (created 2026-01-15):
- Delta adds "GraphQL Schema" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/api/graphql.ts

Resolution: Both implemented. Will apply add-rest-api specs first,
then add-graphql specs (chronological order, newer takes precedence).
\`\`\`

**Output On Success**

\`\`\`
## Bulk Archive Complete

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-1>/
- <change-2> -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-2>/

Spec sync summary:
- N delta specs synced to main specs
- No conflicts (or: M conflicts resolved)
\`\`\`

**Output On Partial Success**

\`\`\`
## Bulk Archive Complete (partial)

Archived N changes:
- <change-1> -> archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-1>/

Skipped M changes:
- <change-2> (user chose not to archive incomplete)

Failed K changes:
- <change-3>: Archive directory already exists
\`\`\`

**Output When No Changes**

\`\`\`
## No Changes to Archive

No active changes found. Use \`/opsx:new\` to create a new change.
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Allow any number of changes (1+ is fine, 2+ is the typical use case)
- Always prompt for selection, never auto-select
- Detect spec conflicts early and resolve by checking codebase
- When both changes are implemented, apply specs in chronological order
- Skip spec sync only when implementation is missing (warn user)
- Show clear per-change status before confirming
- Use single confirmation for entire batch
- Track and report all outcomes (success/skip/fail)
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive
- Archive directory target uses current date: YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
- If archive target exists, fail that change but continue with others`
